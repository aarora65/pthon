###`Q-1:` Create a random 3x4 matrix with value between 0-100. And perform below tasks

    i. Sort this matrix. np.sort()
    ii. Sort this matrix based on values in 2nd column.
    iii. Sort this matrix based on max value in each row.
    iv. Sort based on elements value.

See examples:
```
arr =
    [[92 90 74]
    [ 6 63 93]
    [15 93 96]
    [70 60 48]]
```
```
i. np.sort
[[74 90 92]
 [ 6 63 93]
 [15 93 96]
 [48 60 70]]

ii. based on 2nd column
[[70 60 48]
 [ 6 63 93]
 [92 90 74]
 [15 93 96]]

iii. based on row max- ascending
[[15 93 96]
 [ 6 63 93]
 [92 90 74]
 [70 60 48]]

iv. based on elements value
[[ 6 15 48]
 [60 63 70]
 [74 90 92]
 [93 93 96]]

"""###`Q-2:` There is an array of marks of 5 students in 4 subjects. Further you are asked to perform below task.
    i. Add marks every student of an extra subject in the same array.
    ii. Add two new students marks in respective 5 subjects.(one subject added in above task)
    iii. Add extra column with sum of all subjects(5-subjects) marks
    iv. Sort the array(non-ascending order) on total marks column--one added in above task. Show top 2 rows.

Note: Change dimension of arrays during concatenation or appending if required.

Given Array-
```
marks = [[13, 10,  9, 33],
       [63, 46, 90, 42],
       [39, 76, 13, 29],
       [82,  9, 29, 78],
       [67, 61, 59, 36]]

extra_subject = [41, 87, 72, 36, 92]
#Two extra students record-
rec1 = [77, 83, 98, 95, 89]
rec2 = [92, 71, 52, 61, 53]

"""###`Q-3:` Find unique arrays from a 2D array column wise and row wise.
```
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,3,1,1],

 [1 2 3 3 1 1]
 [1 2 3 8 8 8]]

Col Wise
[[1 1 2 3 3]

 [1 8 2 3 8]
 [1 1 2 3 3]]
