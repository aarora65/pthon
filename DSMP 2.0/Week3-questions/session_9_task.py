### `Problem-1:` Class inheritence

Create a **Bus** child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
"""

# Write code here

"""### `Problem-2:` Class Inheritence

Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class. Give the capacity argument of *Bus.seating_capacity()* a default value of 50.

Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class.

"""### `Problem-3:` Write a program that has a class Point. Define another class Location which has two objects (Location & Destination) of class Point. Also define a function in Location that prints the reflection of Destination on the x axis."""



"""### `Problem-4:` Write a program that has an abstract class Polygon. Derive two classes Rectangle and Triamgle from Polygon and write methods to get the details of their dimensions and hence calculate the area."""



"""### `Problem-5:` Write a program with class Bill. The users have the option to pay the bill either by cheque or by cash. Use the inheritance to model this situation."""



"""###`Q-6:` FlexibleDict
As of now we are accessing values from dictionary with exact keys. Now we want to amend accessing values functionality. if a dict have key `1` (int) the even if we try to access values by giving `'1'` (1 as str) as key, we should get the same result and vice versa.

Write a class `FlexibleDict` upon builtin `dict` class with above required functionality.

Hint- `dict[key] => dict.__getitem__(key)`

Ex.
```
fd = FlexibleDict()
fd['a'] = 100
print(fd['a']) # Like regular dict

fd[5] = 500
print(fd[5]) # Like regular dict

fd[1] = 100
print(fd['1']) # actual Key is int but still trying to access through str key.
fd['1'] = 100
print(fd[1])

```
`Output:`
```
100
500
100
100

```
